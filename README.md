# Analyzing Sales Data

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing sales data to extract insights and trends that can help businesses improve their strategies and decision-making. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook, which includes various data manipulation and visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from [DataRockie by P'Toy](https://datarockie.com/). It contains sales transactions, including various features such as:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Product**: Name or category of the product sold.
- **Quantity Ordered**: The number of units sold.
- **Price Each**: The price of a single unit.
- **Order Date**: The date when the transaction took place.
- **Sales**: Total revenue generated from the sale.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for the customer making the purchase.

The dataset allows for various analyses, including sales trends over time, product performance, and customer buying patterns.

## Notebook

The project covers:
1. **Data Import**: Loading the sales dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights such as total sales, average order value, and top-selling products.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate trends and patterns.
